# Firewall Project

## Overview

The **Firewall Project** is a comprehensive solution for both defensive and offensive aspects of network security. It includes a Python-based firewall for managing and processing network packets and a suite of attack simulations to test the firewall's defenses. Key features include:

- **Firewall Management**: Process and manage network packets based on predefined rules.
- **Attack Simulations**: Test the firewall's robustness with simulated network attacks.
- **Logging and Notifications**: Real-time logging of activities and email notifications for various events.
- **Periodic Testing**: Regular testing of the firewall functionality.
- **Packet Sniffing**: Capture and analyze network packets in real-time.

## Directory Structure

- **`firewall/`**: Core firewall logic and components.
  - `firewall.py`: Main firewall logic for processing packets and managing rules.
  - `packet.py`: Defines the `Packet` class for network packet representation.
  - `rule.py`: Contains definitions for firewall rules and types.
  - `enums.py`: Enumerations for actions and rule types.
- **`attacks/`**: Attack simulation scripts.
  - `attack_simulator.py`: Simulates attacks to test firewall defenses.
- **`defense/`**: Scripts for running and managing the firewall.
  - `packet_sniffer.py`: Captures and processes network packets.
  - `periodic_test.py`: Periodically tests the firewall by sending requests.
  - `run_firewall.py`: Initializes and runs the firewall.
  - `server.py`: Flask server for handling packet processing and HTTP requests.
- **`tests/`**: Unit and integration tests.
- **`docs/`**: Project documentation.
- **`config/`**: Configuration files.
- **`logs/`**: Log files generated by the firewall and related scripts.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/firewall-project.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd firewall-project
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - On Windows:

      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

5. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Firewall

To start the firewall and test its functionality, run:

```bash
python defense/run_firewall.py
To start the Flask server for handling packet processing and HTTP requests, run:

bash
Copy code
python defense/server.py
Testing the Firewall
Periodic Testing
Use the following command to periodically test the firewall:

bash
Copy code
python defense/periodic_test.py
Packet Sniffing
To capture and process network packets in real-time, use:

bash
Copy code
python defense/packet_sniffer.py
Attack Simulation
To simulate attacks and test the firewall defenses, use:

bash
Copy code
python attacks/attack_simulator.py
Logging and Notifications
Logs are stored in C:/Users/Mor/Desktop/OpenFlowFirewall/firewall_project/logs/firewall.log.

Email notifications are configured in defense/server.py. Ensure the email settings are properly configured with your credentials for sending notifications.

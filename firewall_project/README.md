# Firewall Project

## Overview

The **Firewall Project** is designed to showcase both defensive and offensive aspects of firewall management. The project includes a Python-based firewall to protect network traffic and a set of attack simulations to test its robustness. It features:

- Packet processing and rule management
- Logging and email notifications
- Periodic testing and real-time packet sniffing
- Attack simulations to test firewall defenses

## Directory Structure

- **`firewall/`**: Contains the core fire.
  - `firewall.py`: Main firewall logic for managing and processing network packets.
  - `packet.py`: Defines the `Packet` class for representing network packets.
  - `rule.py`: Contains definitions for firewall rules and rule types.
  - `enums.py`: Enumerations for actions and rule types.
- **`attacks/`**: Contains scripts to simulate various network attacks.
  - `attack_simulator.py`: Simulates attacks to test the firewall's defenses.
- **`defense/`**: Contains scripts to manage and run the firewall.
  - `packet_sniffer.py`: Sniffs network packets and processes them through the firewall.
  - `periodic_test.py`: Performs periodic tests of the firewall.
  - `run_firewall.py`: Initializes and runs the firewall.
  - `server.py`: Flask-based server for handling HTTP requests and processing packets.
- **`tests/`**: Unit and integration tests for the firewall.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation related to the project.
- **`config/`**: Configuration files for the project.
- **`logs/`**: Log files generated by the firewall and scripts.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/firewall-project.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd firewall-project
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - On Windows:

      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

5. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Firewall

To start the firewall and test its functionality, use:

```bash
python defense/run_firewall.py
To start the Flask server for processing packets and handling HTTP requests, use:



python defense/server.py
Testing the Firewall
Periodic Testing
The project includes a script to periodically test the firewall by sending HTTP requests:



python defense/periodic_test.py
Packet Sniffing
For real-time packet sniffing and processing, use:


python defense/packet_sniffer.py
Attack Simulation
To simulate attacks and test the firewall's defenses, use:



python attacks/attack_simulator.py
